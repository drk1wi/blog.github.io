I am a security consultant, researcher and a developer with more than 10 years of professional experience.
I did my MSc and Bsc(Hons) back in the days, along with the OSCP && OSCE certificates.

I specialize in web and mobile application security and enjoy crafting technically interesting solutions that achieve a particular task, through often not so standard approach.
