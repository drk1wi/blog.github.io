I am a security consultant, researcher and a developer with more than 10 years of professional experience.
I did my MSc and Bsc(Hons) back in the days, along with such certificates as OSCE && OSCP (Really enjoyed the "Try Harder" approach ᕙ(⇀‸↼‶)ᕗ, which I find very useful in my day to day tasks..)

I specialize in web and mobile application security, crafting creative solutions that are fit for a particular task and IT security consultancy.
