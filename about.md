I am a security consultant, researcher and a developer with more than 10 years of professional experience.
I did my MSc and Bsc(Hons) along with OSCP && OSCE - really enjoyed the "Try Harder" approach ᕙ(⇀‸↼‶)ᕗ.

I specialize in web and mobile application security, IT security consultancy and enjoy developing solutions that are fit for a particular task.
